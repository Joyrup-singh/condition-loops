What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.

A conditional statement is either a simple conditional statement (IF,EVALUTE,SEARCH)
or conditional statement made up of an imperative statement that includes a conditional phrase or option.
You can end a conditional statement with an implicit or explicit scope terminator.

Syntax:

if () condition 
{
     logic 
}
else if () condition  
{
     logic 
}
else {
    Default Decision
}

Example:

if (time < 10) {
  greeting = "Good morning";
} else if (time < 20) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}
